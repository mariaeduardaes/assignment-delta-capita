This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.


## OVERVIEW
I decided to use Next.js because it gives me both the frontend and a backend in the same project. That way, I donâ€™t need to set up multiple services, and it keeps the whole solution easier to develop and maintain.
Also I could easily deploy with Vercel, so the app is quickly accesible at the internet and on mobile devices

For tests I created mocks to test the services behavior. 
 
If I had more time, I would put a little more effort at the UI to create a more enjoyable interface (it is my favorite part).

And I would create tests for the API, I tried but I had difficulty with the mock for fetchAPI for class response.
